# android-dev-geofenceproject-consumer

This is a project made for the 2021-22 class on AndroidDev at Harokopio University of Athens, Department of Informatics and Telematics.

It is made to work in parallel with https://github.com/Ancairon/androiddev-geofence-project which is the main app.
This app fetches the geofences the content provider on AndroidDev gives, and it presents them in a map!

> *Note, a working Google Maps API key is needed to work, you need to replace it in the manifest. Check [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for more info*
